Calculator Testing with NUnit

This repository contains a comprehensive testing suite for a Calculator application using NUnit. The tests are structured to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application by covering unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.



Overview

The Calculator application includes the following functionalities:

Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Expression Evaluation: Parsing and calculating complex mathematical expressions

The testing suite is designed to validate each module, test interactions between modules, and ensure the entire application works as expected in real-world scenarios.


Testing Approach

The testing is divided into Two stages:

Unit Testing: Validates individual modules (e.g., addition, subtraction).

System Testing: Tests the complete application to ensure end-to-end functionality.


Allure Report Integration

To enhance the testing experience and visualize test results, Allure Reports have been integrated into the testing process.
